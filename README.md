# My-Touch
 Photo Editing and manipulation software

 made using Godot Engine
 
 big thanks to material maker for its open source code, it helped me do the UI part.
 
 also thanks to pixelorama for their open source code, I learned methods for canvas and tool handling.

# Notes for contributers

The current version of Godot for the project is : Godot 4 RC 2

the project has a lot of files from material maker/pixelorama and it is not organised, yet.
