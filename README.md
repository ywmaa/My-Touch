# My-Touch
 Photo Editing and manipulation software

 made using Godot Engine
 
 big thanks to material maker for its open source code, it helped me do the UI part.
 
 also thanks to pixelorama for their open source code, I learned methods for canvas and tool handling.

 finally thanks to sprite_painter addon, I was able to have an idea of better tooling system.
